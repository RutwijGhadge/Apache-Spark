# Apache Spark & Scala â€“ Database Connectivity and Query Optimization

This repository contains my learning journey with **Apache Spark** and **Scala**, focusing on:

- Connecting Spark applications to relational databases (JDBC integration).
- Writing and executing queries efficiently with SparkSQL and DataFrames.
- Exploring best practices for query optimization and performance tuning.
- Hands-on examples for real-world big data processing scenarios.

The goal of this repo is to document concepts, code snippets, and experiments while improving my skills in **big data engineering** and **distributed data processing**.
